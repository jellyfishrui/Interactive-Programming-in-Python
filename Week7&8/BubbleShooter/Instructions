A simpler version of BubbleShooter similar to this web game:
http://absolutist.com/online/bubble-shooter

The user adjusts the angle to shoot bubbles, which can dissolve others of the same color, or stick to the wall. 
(This simplified version doesn't include the dissolving function, only shooting, rotating and sticking).
