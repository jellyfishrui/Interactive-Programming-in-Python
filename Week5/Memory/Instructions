Memory is a card game in which the player deals out a set of cards face down. In Memory, a turn (or a move) consists of the player 
flipping over two cards. If they match, the player leaves them face up. If they don't match, the player flips the cards back face down. 
The goal of Memory is to end up with all of the cards flipped face up in the minimum number of turns. For this project, 
we will keep our model for Memory fairly simple. A Memory deck consists of eight pairs of matching cards.


See the gif file in this folder for the effects.

1) The game draws 16 cards on the canvas (horizontally or as a grid).
2) The cards appear in eight unique pairs.
3) The game ignores clicks on exposed cards.
4) At the start of the game, a click on a card exposes the card that was clicked on.
5) If one unpaired card is exposed, a click on a second unexposed card exposes the card that was clicked on.
6) If two unpaired cards are exposed, a click on an unexposed card exposes the card that was clicked on and flips the two unpaired cards over.
7) If all exposed cards are paired, a click on an unexposed card exposes the card that was clicked on and does not flip any other cards.
8) Cards paired by two clicks in the same turn remain exposed until the start of the next game.
9) The game updates and displays the number of turns in the current game in a label displayed in the control area. 
The counter may be incremented after either the first or second card is flipped during a turn.
10) The game includes a "Reset" button that resets the turn counter and restarts the game.
11) The deck is also randomly shuffled each time the "Reset" button is pressed, so that the cards are in a different order each game.
