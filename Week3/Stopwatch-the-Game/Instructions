Mini-project description - "Stopwatch: The Game"

Our mini-project for this week will focus on combining text drawing in the canvas with timers to build a simple digital 
stopwatch that keeps track of the time in tenths of a second. 

The stopwatch should contain "Start", "Stop" and "Reset" buttons. 

Mini-project development process

    Construct a timer with an associated interval of 0.1 seconds whose event handler increments a global integer. 
    (Remember that create_timer takes the interval specified in milliseconds.) This integer will keep track of the time in tenths of seconds.
    Test your timer by printing this global integer to the console. Use the CodeSkulptor reset button in the blue menu bar to terminate your
    program and stop the timer and its print statements. Important: Do not use floating point numbers to keep track of tenths of a second! 
    While it's certainly possible to get it working, the imprecision of floating point can make your life miserable. Use an integer instead,
    i.e., 12 represents 1.2 seconds.
    
    Write the event handler function for the canvas that draws the current time (simply as an integer, you should not worry about formatting 
    it yet) in the middle of the canvas. Remember that you will need to convert the current time into a string using 
    str before drawing it.
    
    Add "Start" and "Stop" buttons whose event handlers start and stop the timer. Next, add a "Reset" button that stops the timer 
    and reset the current time to zero. The stopwatch should be stopped when the frame opens.
